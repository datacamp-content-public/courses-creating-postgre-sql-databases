Now that we have seen how to represent text data in our database, let's move on to the representation of numeric data.

## Numeric data with discrete values

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "d728e0fe85"
```

`@part1`



`@part2`



`@script`

## Numeric data with continuous values

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "cdb03890bc"
```

`@part1`



`@part2`



`@script`



---
## Integer Types

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "8a408c6e2f"
```

`@part1`



`@script`



---
## Floating-point Types

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b844039e49"
```

`@part1`



`@script`

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "6e8f830bb9"
```

In the next part of this lesson, you will have the opportunity to think through scenarios to determine which column type to use based on the data which you would like to represent in your database. Let's practice!
