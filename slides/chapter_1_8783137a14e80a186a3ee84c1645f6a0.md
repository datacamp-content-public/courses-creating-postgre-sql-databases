Now that we have seen how to represent text data in our database, let's move on to the representation of numeric data.

## Numeric data with discrete values

```yaml
type: TwoRows
key: 1b35274c09
```

`@part1`
```
CREATE TABLE people.employee {
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    
}
```

`@part2`


`@script`
Imagine we are creating a database for a retail clothing store. In such a scenario, we will likely be interested in having a representation for the store's employees. We can store details about the store's employees in a table named "employee". And this table will be part of the "people" schema which may also include details about customers.

In the next part of this lesson, you will have the opportunity to think through scenarios to determine which column type to use based on the data which you would like to represent in your database. Let's practice!
